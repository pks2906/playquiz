While exercising my JavaScript skills, I decided to built a Quiz App. The quiz is grouped into categories such science, current affairs, football and animal questions. its pure vanilla JavaScript (although I added a little jQuery to make it more easier).

It is designed to kill the boredom by answering few simple questions.

The tools I used in this project are;

HTML & CSS,
JavaScript
Material CSS
